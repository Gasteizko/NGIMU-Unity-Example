NGIMU-Unity-Example
===================

This is an example [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) project for connecting to an NGIMU and displaying received data in real-time.  The application will first search for all connections and then allow a specific connect to be opened.  Received quaternion data is displayed as a 3D model.  All received data is overlaid as terminal text.  The project has been tested with Unity version 2017.3.0f3 for serial and Wi-Fi connections on Windows, and Wi-Fi connections on Android.
